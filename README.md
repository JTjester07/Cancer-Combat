# Cancer-Combat

Cancer Combat is a top-down 2D shooter made in two days for
Lame Jame 29. You play as a cell fighting off
cancerous tumors that spread and duplicate,
threatening your life. Cancer Combat was made
in Unity and ported directly to GitHub.

Cancer Combat is playable for free on Itch.io.
