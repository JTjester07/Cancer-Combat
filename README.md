# Cancer-Combat

Cancer Combat is a top-down 2D shooter made in two days for
Lame Jame 29. You play as a cell fighting off
cancerous tumors that spread and duplicate,
threatening your life.

Cancer Combat was made in Unity and placed directly into GitHub,
and is avaliable on my Itch.io page in the "about" section of
this repository.

Cancer Combat was my second game made and my first game jam,
and a large dive into several Unity concepts. With the help
of A.I. Chatbots, I was able to learn a lot of C# implemented
into this game. Cancer Combat was also my first dive into game
design, such as making the game easy to play, difficult enough
to be challenging, but not so challenging that it is impossible.
Such design choices were only possible with constructive
criticism from friends I let playtest the game.

In addition, players can choose different upgrades balanced in
a way that makes them all equally helpful, so players can expieriment
with different combinations of upgrades to destroy the tumors the fastest.
This results in a satisfying gameplay loop of avoiding enemies
and being quick to get high scores and upgrades!
